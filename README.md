# Hotfix!

If you previously installed `scdl`, you will probably have to uninstall it before running these commands. `pip uninstall scdl`.

Install like so:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jackno/scdl.git --branch download_link_hotfix scdl-hotfix
```
```bash
cd scdl-hotfix
```
```bash
pip install -e .
```

Now you can use it like normal, `scdl -l https://soundcloud.com/...`
